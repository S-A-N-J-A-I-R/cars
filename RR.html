        <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker which has operated as a <br>
           wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG since 2003 â€“ as the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce-branded<br> 
           motor cars. The company's administrative and production headquarters are located on the 42-acre (17 ha) <br>
           Goodwood Estate in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.
           <br>
           From 1906 to 2003, motor cars were manufactured and marketed under the Rolls-Royce brand by Rolls-Royce Motors.<br>
           The Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles <br>
           produced before 2003, other than having briefly supplied components and engines. The Bentley Motors Limited <br>
           subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other predecessor <br>
           entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, <br>
           when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.
