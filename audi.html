        <p>Audi AG is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt,<br>
           Bavaria, Germany. A subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine<br>
           production facilities worldwide.
           <br>
           The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century and the initial<br>
           enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch (1868â€“1951). Two other<br> 
           manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer) also contributed to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The <br>
           modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.<br>
           After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen <br>
           merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.
